# EvaluationMethods

Evaluation methods provides two different evaluation methods. Both involve working with words that have multiple senses.

The grouping evaluation problem.
The first presents a list of sentences and the problem is to split those sentences into a fixed number of groups of a fixed size.
For example if the word was 'head' you could have the following senteces:

He got hit right in the head.
You will find my Dad sat at the head of the table.
My head really hurts.
Jim had a really big head.
The head of the church controlled the power.
The highest paid person was the head of sales.
Please position yourself at the bed's head.
I found the page number at the head of the page.
I was pulled in by the head of HR.

There are three different senses of head used in these sentences:
- The upper part of the human body.
- The front, forward or upper part of something.
- The person in charge of something.

The sentences when split correctly by sense into 3 groups of 3 sentences would be:

He got hit right in the head.
My head really hurts.
Jim has a really big head.

You will find my Dad sat at the head of the table.
Please position yourself at the bed's head.
I found the page number at the head of the page.

The head of the church controlled the power.
The highest paid person was the head of sales.
I was pulled in by the head of HR.

So the first evaluation problem is to split a list of sentences mixed up into the groups shown below.

The select best matching sentence from options problem.
The second evaluation problem while similar to the first has one example sentence and a list of option sentences. So using the 
word head again the problem could look like this.

Example sentence:
The head of the church controlled the power.

Option list:
He got hit right in the head.
I found the page number at the head of the page.
I was pulled in by the head of HR.

You will notice that the sense of head used in the three sentences in the option list are different but one matches the sense used in
the example sentence ('The head of the church controlled the power.' matches 'I was pulled in by the head of HR.'). This evaluation
problem involves selecting the sentence from the option list that uses the same sense for a given word in the example sentence.
